Tools for computing and using bit score ratios

So here's the deal, I'm a Biology PhD student with some ideas for improving upon available gene clustering tools, especially when the sequences are fragmented, as is often the case for de novo transcriptomes.  I enjoy writing Python programs, and I'd like to figure out how to implement my ideas such that they can be installed via the Python Package Index and imported into other Python programs, or executed as a stand-alone program for users who just want more standard analyses.   I'm also primarily responsible for analyzing a dozen novel eukaryotic transcriptomes though, as well as maintaining several lab servers and workstations, so development has been slow and irregular.

I also have strong feelings about the value of education, including proper documentation.  My ultimate vision for this project includes rich documentation, but it seems unwise to spend too much time documenting unfinished software.  I'll be updating this repo with my progress, but those who happen upon it will have to excuse the sparse documentation.
